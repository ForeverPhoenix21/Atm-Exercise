## Description:

<p> The Atm-Exercise is built in React that uses input to update and set state for the total amount deposited or withdrawn.   
  
- useState is updated when a new number total is submitted. 
  
- Logic is set so that the user is not able to withdraw the account balance below zero dollars.
  
- The deposit and or Cash back option must be selected for the submit button to populate on screen. 
</p>

## Installation:
<p> You can replicate this project in your favorite code editor and run the program on a server.  
  

## Usage:
